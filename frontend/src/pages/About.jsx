        Outside of work, I have a deep passion for creativity and strategy. I love to sketch, often using it as a way to express ideas and relax my mind. Chess is another hobby I enjoy, as it challenges my problem-solving skills and strategic thinking, much like coding. I also enjoy playing badminton, which helps me stay active and sharp.
